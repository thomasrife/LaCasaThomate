| 
| Living alone is to eat standing up
| On the kitchen countertop
| From the pan, from the pot
| Straight to the mouth
|
| Living alone is to never set the table
| Leaving plates and cutlery
| Always stored away
|
| Living alone is to have a white fridge
| Stained with a few delivery magnets
| It's having an empty fridge
| And a clean kitchen
| 
| Living alone is to dodge the comfort
| Of a chair
| Of a table
| Of a life
| Of a company
| 
| Living alone is to make the bed
| Before sleeping
| Once a week
| 
| Living alone is to use the desk as a table
| The table as a TV stand
| The TV stand as a chair
| The chair as a closet
| The closet as a shower
| The shower as a toilet
| The toilet as an ashtray
| The ashtray as a hanger
| The hanger as a rope
| The rope as a life vest
| And maybe the knives
| As tissues
| 
| Living alone is a metamorphosis
| Without transformation
| A permanent cocoon
| An imaginary butterfly
| A forgotten caterpillar
| A flight without takeoff
| A landing without ground
| A land without a shore
| 
| Living alone is to make a list
| Of what's always missing
| And you won't buy
| Nor will anyone gift you.
